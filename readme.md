#Introduction 

The project “Quick Parcel” is a web-based system, that serves people by delivering parcels like files, documents, electronic devices, etc. In this project, we will try to cover the whole of Bangladesh to deliver parcels. But the main goal of our project is to deliver a parcel from Capital Dhaka to any district or any district to Dhaka within one day. Now a day some courier service systems are available in Bangladesh but those are taken huge time such as 2 or 3 days for a simple delivery. Actually, our project is the updated version of the courier service that reduces time and cost and fully online-based system. In our country’s perspective, online based platform issue is very important and popular. For this reason, we made this servicing system platform that is fully online base platform. This system is responsive and user-friendly. We develop this project, for front-end development using such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. For back-end development , we use PHP and MYSQL.
